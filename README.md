# Bitcoin-LSTM-Price-Prediction
This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict Bitcoin closing prices based on historical data. It includes year-wise EDA on Open, High, Low, and Close values, model training with normalized close prices, and evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, RÂ², and variance scores.
